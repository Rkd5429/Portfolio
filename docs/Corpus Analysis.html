        <div class="SecondDiv">
            <p>For this project, I’ve decided to work with two authors who have mainly done horror
                element stories.</p>
            <p>I’ve used two short stories by Edgar Allan Poe (The Tell-Tale Heart and The Cask of
                Amontillado) and one novel by Stephen King (The Shining).</p>
            <p>What I'm hoping to gather from both of these authors when I compare them is the
                differences in writing, the way characters refer to each other, and the</p>
            <p>way the “horror” aspect happens within the text.</p>
            <br />
            <p>On the left side, I have The Shining.</p>
            <p>On the right side, I have The Tell Tale Heart and The Cask of Amontillado</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column" style="background-color:Tan; Border: solid;">
                <h2>The Shining</h2>
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">The Shining was filled to the brim
                    with stop words such as “a,” “the,” “is,” “are”. Those very same words were
                    placed as the most occuring words within the text which to me is problematic.
                    The Word "a" for example had a staggering count of roughly 3800 times. Without
                    even writting down the amount for each of those stop words we cam already assume
                    that the most written words were in fact stop words. So I decided to purge many
                    of those words until more interesting words could be found. </p>
                <br />
                <p>Now that the annoying words have been purged, I can finally see the more
                    important words appear with the now highest word count.</p>
                <br />
                <h2>Word Count</h2>
                <ul style="list-style-position: inside;text-align: center; ">
                    <li style="font-size: 22px;">Danny = 917</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 22px;">Jack = 750</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 22px;">Been = 678</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 22px;">There = 655</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 22px;">Like = 648</li>
                </ul>

                </figure>
                <br />
                <p>The N-Grams that I found from The Shining were not quite what I expected,
                    although maybe I should have. For the N-grams, I never actually used any of the
                    common words when finding them, meaning I just found the most common sentences
                    in general based off of nothing but the text itself. For now I'll use the
                    N-Grams that have any interesting details instead of the top five. </p>
                <br />
                <h2>N-Grams</h2>
                <ul style="list-style-position: inside;text-align: center; ">
                    <li style="font-size: 22px;">been sleepwalking again my dear </li>

                <br />
                <p>I looked at two clusters within Antconc for The Shining and decided to use both
                    Jack and Danny for them.</p>
                <br />
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/Danny%20Cluster.png" alt="The Shining" />
                    <figcaption>Danny: 1047 hits</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <br />
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/Jack%20Cluster.png" alt="The Shining" />
                    <figcaption>Jack: 831 hits</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <br />
                <p>The clusters told me a small amount of information about the two characters. For
                    starters, while the first cluster doesnt quite say so but the second one has a
                    lot of information that suggests that Danny and Jack are typically seen together
                    within the story. Thats also where the shining differs from the short stories.
                    The short stories dont seem to have groups of people, just one person.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column" style="background-color:Tan; Border: solid;">
                <h2>The Tell Tale Heart and The Cask of Amontillado</h2>
                <br />
                <h2>The Tell Tale Heart</h2>
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">Just like the Shining, stop words
                    dominated the top spot of most occured. SO I did what had to be done to reveal
                    the better words. Although I did expect the number at which these words were
                    written to be low since The Tell Tale heart, like a lot of his works, are just
                    short stories which span a few pages at most, I did not expect however that the
                    most used word outside of stop words to be only found 15 times.</p>
                <br />
                <h2>Word Count</h2>
                <ul style="list-style-position: inside;text-align: center; ">
                    <li style="font-size: 22px;">Old = 15</li>

                    <li style="font-size: 22px;">Heart = 12</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 22px;">Heard = 11</li>
                </ul>

                </figure>
                <br />
                <p>The N-Grams for The Tell Tale Heart seem to hint at noise being the "horror"
                    within the short story. It also seems like the main character is an old man.
                    This of course wasnt decided from just the first N-Gram but mainly because none
                    of the other words signify the interaction between two individuals which makes
                    me think that the character is being described from the third person through the
                    story. But that doesnt quite matter.</p>

                <h2>The Cask of Amontillado</h2>
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">The Cask of Amontillado surprised me
                    with the lack of stop words. It still had a mass amount of them, but
                    significantly less than The Tell Tale Heart and especially The Shining. The most
                    used word outside of stop words was found an astounding 24 times. <br />

                <p>The N-Grams for The Cask of Amontillado have been amusing with first N-Gram being
                    "ugh ugh ugh ugh". This was used within the text a total of twelve times. Beyond
                    seeing that without context, I think that it actually fits well into what the
                    horror element of what this short story could be. The other N-Grams that were
                    worth mentioning made it seem as if ghosts or some supernatural entity were the
                    main element. It even further pushes that thought when we see the word
                    "catacombs".</p>

            <p>The screen captures show the differences between the two authors. From their use of
                words and feel of the sentences. Of course, there are massive differences between a
                book and two short stories but I feel like it goes even beyond that to a point. I've
                never read any of the text that I'm using and I only plan to do so when it would
                benefit the asignment in doing so, so I could be wrong. Edgar Allan Poe seems to
                write his stories in a poem like way, while Stephen King simply writes his lines
                like normal. Edgar Allan Poe embodies one aspect of the horror and Stephen King has
                larger variety of them.</p>
