        <p>Welcome to my about me page</p>
        <br>
        <p>Im currently attending Penn State Behrend. Here's the link for their <a
                href="https://behrend.psu.edu/penn-state-behrend"> home page</a>.</p>
        <p>Im in my second year here at Behrend and looking to transfer either to University Park or
            another university after this year</p>
        <p>As for my major, I'm technically undecided. I would love however to start a major in <a
                href="https://arts.psu.edu/academics/stuckeman-school/"> Architecture</a>. Which is
            why I want to transfer so badly.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Besides school I have an interest in art, hiking, video games, and a few other
            things.</p>
        <p>To keep the masses entertained, I'll now show a picture of my cat</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/Poppy.jpg" />
            <figcaption>This is a really zoomed in picture of my cat Poppy</figcaption>
