                <h2>Reflective Essay: HTML</h2>
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;"> Working on this website for a
                    section of the semester has been a nice introduction into the world of HTML
                    coding. There has been some struggle and constant google searches of how to put
                    images side by side but I eventually understood how things worked even if I
                    still need to look up more of the more basic questions.</p>
                <br />
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">The most significant challenge for
                    me when I started making this site is that I didnt understand very much about
                    it. That was until I had an idea in my head of what I wanted and started playing
                    around with code. Theres thinking involved but most of the time some other
                    person already thought up and created what you wanted. So sometimes its as easy
                    as copying and pasteing code and molding it into a more perfect version of your
                    vison. The second most difficult challenge, like most things, is the amount of
                    time it takes to get things perfect and into place. </p>
                <br />
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">In terms of comparison between both
                    site creation methods, I'd rather take the "build it all from the ground up"
                    approach. I think it's nice how you have themes to choose from but it kinda gets
                    in the way of what you actually want. Theres also the chance that my opionion of
                    making a site using Penn States "Sites" would be the opposite If I were to start
                    drafting everything on there instead of within oXygen. </p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">The challenges of modifying the
                    layout of either site is that its hard to make it extremely detailed. You dont
                    really have the ability to make any complex shapes from what I've gathered so
                    far in oXygen. I've only been able to have squares, rectangels, and the
                    occasional rounded angle squares.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">You dont really need to have any
                    specific skills in order to learn or develope sites like this in my opinion..
                    Maybe knowing how to read would be a good start. The one joke aside, I dont
                    believe you need to meet any sort of skill based requirement to start learning
                    how to code in html, just time and commitment</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">Im not entirely sure what skills I'd
                    like to learn in order to improve this website besides finding a better way in
                    organizing my code. It's been kinda confusing trying to find that one thing that
                    I'd like to change in a sea of identical code. If its possible, I'd like to
                    include color coded matching. Just something that is simpler to find. Kinda like
                    using a highlighter on a piece of paper I suppose. </p>

                <h2>Reflective Essay: Penn State Sites</h2>
                <br />
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">The most significant challenge that
                    a new learner will face when making a Penn State Site is not knowing what or
                    where things are located and the purpose behind them. The website is hard to
                    navigate and I wasnt really sure where to even go after I put down the
                    information that I needed for my pages.</p>
                <br />
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">I think that at least one advantage
                    of using the Penn State Sites is that you have a sort of layout that you can
                    follow. Starting from nothing has its benefits and I do prefer a blank slate
                    over a layout but I do think looking at the themes and the examples that are
                    being displayed with them can prove to be somewhat inspiring.</p>
                <br />
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">Modifying this site has been quite
                    infuriating so far. Maybe its because I've spent significantly less time on this
                    method but it more or less seems that I dont have as much freedom as one should
                    have when creating something like this.</p>
                <br />
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">Developing anything within the Penn
                    State Sites requires the certain skills that I do not yet have. For example, for
                    the index page I struggled in centering the frog as i've done before. No matter
                    what I do, the frog keeps on being held on the left side of the screen rather
                    than the middle. I've tried altering my code to fix this issue but nothing seems
                    to work. Even formating the picture with the tools the website provides is not
                    quite working for me. I'm sure its just some confliction between a number of
                    things but I'm not sure how to figure out if thats really the case. </p>
