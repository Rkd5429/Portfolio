                    <strong>What features create the illusion of the "world"?</strong> The features
                    that create the world of this game are mostly the obstacles that you have to
                    avoid with a small amount of the visual sense of the world being the sprites
                    that each object and individual has. The main hazards are the archers who shoot
                    only arrows down at you in a straight verticle line and the curse that your
                    character holds which happens to be a huge sword. There are two obstacles that
                    you must go through in order to beat the level. Blocks of rock placed in
                    unconvienent positions block your path in a maze like manner and the occasional
                    body of water that slows you down. </p>
                <br />
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">
                    <strong>How complex are the settings?</strong>As far as settings go, there are
                    none to begin with. Although thats not really a big issue for me as the game
                    audio is fairly quiet while also not being to loud.</p>
                <br />
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">
                    <strong>What Character do you control. How do you get to know the character and
                        what kind of interactions do you have with other characters?</strong>You
                    play as the character known as Amina. She works for the Fireball Express Company
                    as a courier to deliver packages through dangerous lands and a huge spinning
                    sword that follows her on every journey. The only information we get on the
                    sword is that Amina has been cursed to always be attacked by a giant sword.</p>
                <br />
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">
                    <strong>How does the game challenge you and what kind of objects do you
                        encounter?</strong>The game challenges you from the moment you press play.
                    You spawn with five total hearts, and a bar that indicates the amount of luggage
                    that you have. Once you start playing, the referenced curse appears before you
                    with killing intent and lunges at you with unexpected force. The only way
                    forward is right so you march on or rather sprint for the end to avoid getting
                    within the way of the sword. That is until you get blocked by a stone wall that
                    gets in your way and the only way past it is through it, so why not make the
                    sword useful and bait it into destroying the wall. Everything past the wall is
                    also a threat from an army of archers, randomly placed blocks, and ponds with
                    bridges that break from the slightest amount of weight. Did I mention that you
                    fight a bear? Well before the end goal is reached you fight the final encounter
                    which just so happens to be a bear. The bear fights slightly like the sword and
                    spins before lunging towards you. And just as one would break a wall, you have
                    to use the sword to get past the bear.</p>
                <br />
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">
                    <strong>How is the music?</strong>The music is great! It's upbeat and almost
                    fitting. It's not intense but its not boring. The music starts only after you
                    trigger the sword spawn and only ends once you either beat the game or fail the
                    mission. There is no menu music sadly but thats easy to look past because the
                    majority of the game is spent running towards the end goal instead of staring at
                    two buttons.</p>
                <br />
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">
                    <strong>Does the game comment on our reality?</strong>This I can say for sure is
                    a no. The game does not comment on our reality.</p>
                <br />
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">
                    <strong>How could this game develope in the future?</strong>Games like this are
                    just the beginning of something that could potentially be turned from something
                    small into something larger. For starters, make more levels. This is a necessary
                    addition that needs to be added and it's the more obvious addiition as well. The
                    second addition would most likely be more characters. More characters would open
                    up many more options as well. The main character, Amina is great but an evolving
                    storyline would make her even better. Maybe something that explains the curse or
                    maybe a way to eventually get rid of it. The developer seems to have ideas for
                    it's future as well since you get a sum of money after you reach the end.
                    Currency is a great way to inroduce items or unlock new areas to run through.
                    I'm basically saything that the game needs to expand in every which way.</p>
